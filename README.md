# Heart Disease Data Analysis 🫀📊

This project explores a heart disease dataset to uncover insights that may assist in early diagnosis and prevention. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project walks through a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) workflow—from data cleaning to visualization.

## 🔍 Key Features
- Cleaned and validated dataset (nulls, duplicates)
- Statistical summary of health indicators
- Correlation matrix and heatmap
- Visual insights into age, gender, chest pain, cholesterol, and blood pressure
- Target-based analysis to identify heart disease risk factors

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included
- `Heart Disease Analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with all code and visualizations
- `heart.csv` — Dataset used for analysis
- `README.md` — Project overview

## 💡 Outcome
The project demonstrates exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills and highlights relationships between health metrics and the presence of heart disease. Insights gained could support predictive modeling and clinical decision-making.
